        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Fill a large bowl with ice water and set aside near the stove. With a pairing knife, remove the core from the cabbage. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Place the head of cabbage, stem side up in the pot. Let the cabbage simmer for about 7-8 minutes. Use tongs to gently remove the leaves, one by one, as they separate from the head and place them in the ice water bath. You will need 12 leaves. When you have 12, pat them dry and discard any tough ribs at the bottom of each leaf.

            <li>
                Add the vegetable oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for one additional minute. Remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place one cup of the sauerkraut in the bottom of a large Dutch oven. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, combine ground pork, rice, 1 teaspoon paprika, kosher salt, pepper, eggs and onion mixture. Mix well with your hands. Set aside.
                For the sauce, in a medium bowl, whisk together the 2 cups water, tomato paste, remaining 3 teaspoons paprika. Add the remaining sauerkraut. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, place about 1/3 cup of the filling mixture in a log-like shape at the bottom of each leaf, then you'll tuck in the sides as you roll. Place the rolls seam-side down in the prepared Dutch oven. Pour the sauce over the cabbage rolls. Cover the dish and bake for one hour until the meat is cooked though. Serve immediately.
